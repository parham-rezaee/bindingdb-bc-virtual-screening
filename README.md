# bindingdb-bc-virtual-screening 

This repository contains multiple Python scripts for a project titled "_Screening of BindingDB database ligands against EGFR, HER2, Estrogen, Progesterone, and NF-kB receptors using machine learning and molecular docking_". The project was conducted at Tarbiat Modares University as part of the requirements for a Master of Science degree. We would like to acknowledge the UNESCO UNISA iThemba-LABS/NRF Africa Chair in Nanoscience & Nanotechnology (U2ACN2) and the Centre for High-Performance Computing (CHPC), South Africa for providing computational resources and facilities.

**Please take note that you are responsible for calculating the descriptors of the BindingDB ligands on your own.**
